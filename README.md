## Description

- This code displays a text editor called "JATE" (Just Another Text Editor).
- I wanted to create a simple text editor that runs in the browser and meets PWA (Progressive Web Application) criteria (uses a web manifest file, is served using https, and registers a service worker with a fetch event handler). 
- I coded JavaScript using Express & If-Env. I deployed using Heroku. 
- Given more time I would include concise comments, detailed error messages, and thorough tests.
